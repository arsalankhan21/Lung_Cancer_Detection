## **Introduction**  
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models to aid radiologists in diagnosing NSCLC using CT scan images.

---

## **Abstract**  
Approximately 80% of lung cancer cases are classified as NSCLC, which is often undetectable until advanced stages. This project aims to develop a tool for early detection of NSCLC through CNN-based analysis of CT scans. Using Keras, TensorFlow, and Gradio, the system integrates pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 in an ensemble approach to improve diagnostic accuracy.

## **Dataset**  
The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), contains CT scans categorized as:  
- **Adenocarcinoma**  
- **Large Cell Carcinoma**  
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**  
- **Normal (Healthy)**  

### **Data Split**  
- **Training Set**: 464 images (70%)  
- **Validation Set**: 72 images (10%)  
- **Testing Set**: 315 images (20%)

## **Solution Overview**  

### **Simple CNN**  
A custom-built CNN architecture for feature extraction and classification.  
- **Advantages**: Lightweight and simple to implement.  
- **Limitations**: Limited performance on complex datasets.  

### **VGG16**  
A pre-trained model on ImageNet, fine-tuned for NSCLC classification.  
- **Advantages**: Strong feature extraction and transfer learning capabilities.  
- **Limitations**: Computationally intensive.  

### **ResNet50**  
Utilizes residual learning to address the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.  
- **Advantages**: High accuracy for complex tasks.  
- **Limitations**: Longer training times.  

### **InceptionV3**  
Uses inception modules to capture diverse spatial features in images.  
- **Advantages**: Efficient in handling varying feature scales.  
- **Limitations**: Susceptible to overfitting without proper regularization.  

---

## **Ensemble Approach**  
An ensemble of VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 is implemented to combine the strengths of each model. Predictions are averaged to reduce bias and improve generalization.

---

## **Tools and Libraries**  
- **Keras**: Model prototyping and training.  
- **TensorFlow**: Backend for scalability.  
- **Gradio**: Interactive front-end interface.  
- **PIL**: Image manipulation and preprocessing.  
- **OpenCV**: Image resizing and normalization.  
- **NumPy**: Array manipulation.  
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.  
- **Scikit-learn**: Evaluation metrics and statistical modeling.

## **Performance**  

### **Model Accuracy**  
| Model       | Accuracy (%) | Loss  |  
|-------------|--------------|-------|  
| Simple CNN  | 34.92        | 1.3088|  
| VGG16       | 54.92        | 1.0669|  
| ResNet50    | 58.73        | 1.0037|  
| InceptionV3 | 56.19        | 1.1073|  
| Ensemble    | 54.29        | -     |  

### **Observations**  
- The ensemble model demonstrated improved generalization.  
- Pre-trained models performed better than the custom CNN in feature extraction and classification.  
- Challenges remain in detecting "Squamous Cell Carcinoma" due to class imbalance.
